## Project: Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Overview

In this project, the student had to make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The student had to write code to (a) import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics, and (b) write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Description
This is a CLI program developed to allow the user to explore an US
bikeshare system database and retrieve statistics information from the database. The user is able filter the information by city, month and weekday, in order to visualize statistics information related to a specific subset of data.

#### Getting Started

This program is structured in 2 steps.

In a first moment, the user selects the filters that are going to be applied to the database. The user is able to chose as many filters as it would like.

After this step, the DataFrame for the analysis is created based on the filters chosen by the user.

In a second moment, the user is able to chose, from a list of options, the statistics the user would like to calculate, based on the available filtered data.

As of April 24, 2020 the user is now able to chose to view raw data and also able sort this data by columns, in ascending or descending order.
